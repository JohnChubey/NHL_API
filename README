Installation:
1) Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2) Make sure you have Pip installed
3) If you don't have it already, download pipenv onto your linux computer using 'pip install pipenv'
4) Navigate to the root directory (where Pipfile is located)
5) Run 'pipenv install' and all the dependencies should be installed

Running the program:
1) Run the command 'export FLASK_APP=index' to export the environment variable!
2) Then run the command 'flask run' and the project should start!
3) Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and start making API calls

Testing:
1) Currently, all tests are run using pytest. To run all tests, run the command 'pytest test_index.py -v' in the root
directory after installing all dependencies and the tests should be run in your terminal.


Extra info:
Currently the only endpoint that works is the '/players' endpoint. This document will be updated in the future
when more are added.
